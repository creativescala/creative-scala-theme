# Features

Here is a brief overview of the features of this template:

- It has some basic [responsive][responsive] features, meaning it adapts to changing screen sizes. On wide screens you'll have a table of contents for the site on the left, and on the right a table of contents for the page. On narrow screens these both disappear and are replaced by a table of contents that is accessed from the top bar.

- It allows [configuration](/configuration/README.md) of the links on the top bar and adding additional Javascript and CSS files. Note that this theme is *not* designed to allow for heavy customization. If you want to change the fonts, color scheme, or make more radical changes, you'll want to fork the theme.

- It provides a range of [directives](/directives/README.md) that I've found useful in documenting my projects.
